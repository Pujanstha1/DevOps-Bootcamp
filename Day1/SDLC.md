# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a structured process used to design, develop, test, and deploy software efficiently. It provides a framework to ensure quality, reduce risk, and meet business requirements.

## SDLC Models
### 1. Waterfall Model
The Waterfall model is a **linear and sequential** approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.

**Phases:** Requirements → Design → Implementation → Testing → Deployment → Maintenance

**Advantages:**
- Simple and easy to understand  
- Well-documented stages  
- Works well for projects with **clear, unchanging requirements**

**Disadvantages:**
- Inflexible to changes once development starts  
- Late testing may cause delays in defect discovery  
- Not ideal for complex or long-term projects

### 2. Agile Model
Agile is an **iterative and incremental** approach emphasizing collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback.

**Key Features:**  
- Work is divided into small iterations (sprints)  
- Continuous testing and integration  
- Regular feedback from stakeholders

**Advantages:**
- Highly flexible and adaptable to changes  
- Faster delivery of functional software  
- Encourages collaboration and continuous improvement

**Disadvantages:**
- Requires active customer involvement  
- Less predictable timelines and scope  
- Can be challenging for large, complex projects without experienced teams

### 3. Other SDLC Models (Brief Overview)
- **V-Model:** Extension of Waterfall; emphasizes verification and validation  
- **Iterative Model:** Builds software in repeated cycles to refine requirements  
- **Spiral Model:** Focuses on risk analysis with iterative development  
- **Big Bang Model:** Minimal planning, development happens quickly; high risk

***Selecting the right SDLC model depends on project complexity, team size, clarity of requirements, and flexibility for changes. Agile is popular today due to its adaptability, while Waterfall remains useful for projects with stable requirements.***
