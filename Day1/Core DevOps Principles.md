## Day 1 - Core DevOps Principles
### Introduction:
DevOps is a culture and set of practices that **bridge ***Development*** and ***Operations***** to deliver software faster, more reliably and with higher quality. At the heart of DevOps are **three core principles** that guide how teams work, learn and improve continuously.
1. Flow - Streamline work to move quickly from code to production.
2. Feedback - Continuously monitor and get early signals about issues.
3. Continual Learning & Experimentation - Learn from successes and failures to improve processes. Safely try new ideas to innovate and optimize.

### DevOps Principles
1. Flow
- Smooth, fast, predictable movement of work
- Minimize handoffs and delays
- Automate tasks: CI/CD, deployments
- Small, frequent changes -> faster delivery

2. Feedback
- Fast, actionable info about code/system
- Automated tests, monitoring, alerts
- Detect problems early -> quicker fixes

3. Continual Learning
- Learn from successes and failures
- Conduct postmortems without blame
- Document and share knowledge

4. Experimentation
- Try new ideas safely -> ***fail fast, learn fast***
- Use staging environments, feature flags
- Measure results before production rollout
