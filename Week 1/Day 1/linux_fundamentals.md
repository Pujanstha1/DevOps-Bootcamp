# Linux Fundamentals

Linux is an open-source, Unix-like operating system widely used in servers, cloud infrastructure, and DevOps environments. Learning Linux fundamentals is essential for managing systems, deploying applications, and automating tasks.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Linux File System
- Hierarchical structure starting from `/` (root)  
- Common directories:
  - `/home` – user directories  
  - `/etc`  – system configuration files  
  - `/var`  – logs and variable data  
  - `/bin`  – essential binaries

### 2. Basic Commands
- File operations: `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`  
- File viewing/editing: `cat`, `less`, `nano`, `vi`  
- Permissions: `chmod`, `chown`, `chgrp`  
- System info: `uname`, `df`, `top`, `ps`, `whoami`  

### 3. Users and Permissions
- Linux is multi-user; each user has a UID and GID  
- Permissions: read (r), write (w), execute (x)  
- Commands: `useradd`, `usermod`, `passwd`, `groups`

### 4. Process Management
- View processes: `ps`, `top`, `htop`  
- Manage processes: `kill`, `killall`, `nice`, `renice`  

### 5. Package Management
- Debian/Ubuntu: `apt-get`, `dpkg`  
- RedHat/CentOS: `yum`, `dnf`, `rpm`  

### 6. Networking
- Check IP: `ip a` or `ifconfig`  
- Test connectivity: `ping`, `curl`, `wget`  
- Network configuration: `netstat`, `ss`, `traceroute`
