# 8. Loops (for, while, until) and Loop Control

Loops allow scripts to **execute commands repeatedly** until a condition is met.

---

## 8.1 for Loop
- Iterates over a list of items

### Syntax
```bash
for var in list; do
    commands
done
```

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
for i in 1 2 3 4 5; do
    echo "Number: $i"
done
```
- Prints numbers 1 to 5

### C-style for loop
```bash
for ((i=0; i<5; i++)); do
    echo $i
done
```
- Initialization: `i=0`
- Condition: `i<5`
- Increment: `i++`

---

## 8.2 while Loop
- Executes commands **while a condition is true**

### Syntax
```bash
while [ condition ]; do
    commands
done
```

### Example
```bash
count=1
while [ $count -le 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

---

## 8.3 until Loop
- Executes commands **until a condition becomes true**

### Syntax
```bash
until [ condition ]; do
    commands
done
```

### Example
```bash
count=1
until [ $count -gt 5 ]; do
    echo "Count: $count"
    count=$((count + 1))
done
```

---

## 8.4 Loop Control
### break
- Exit the loop immediately
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
        break
    fi
    echo $i
done
# Output: 1 2
```

### continue
- Skip current iteration and continue with next
```bash
for i in {1..5}; do
    if [ $i -eq 3 ]; then
        continue
    fi
    echo $i
done
# Output: 1 2 4 5
```

---

## Practical Examples
1. Print all files in a directory:
```bash
for file in /etc/*; do
    echo $file
done
```
2. Countdown using while:
```bash
count=5
while [ $count -gt 0 ]; do
    echo "$count..."
    count=$((count - 1))
done
echo "Lift off!"
```
3. Using until to wait for a file:
```bash
until [ -f /tmp/ready.txt ]; do
    echo "Waiting for file..."
    sleep 1
done
echo "File is ready!"
```

## Summary
- **for** → iterate over items or ranges
- **while** → loop while a condition is true
- **until** → loop until a condition becomes true
- **break / continue** → control loop flow
- Loops make scripts **efficient and dynamic** for repetitive tasks
