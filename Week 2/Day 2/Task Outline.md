## *Weekend Bash Scripting Assignments:*  
### Task 1
Create a bash script that shows everything at `onceserver-dashboard.sh`
- clears screen and shows in color:
- Server name & uptime
- Current user & date
- Disk, memory & CPU usage
- Your external IP
- Last 3 login attempts
### Task 2
Your teammate always asks `“What is the IP of this server?”` so please create a bash script as myip.sh which shows only the private and public IP in a pretty way.
### Task 3
Write `harden.sh` that applies basic security best practices:
- Disables root login via SSH
- Changes SSH port
- Installs and configures fail2ban
- Disables unused services
- Sets up basic firewall rules (ufw or firewalld)
- Creates a report of what was changed
