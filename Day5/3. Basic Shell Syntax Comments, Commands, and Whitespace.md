# 3. Basic Shell Syntax: Comments, Commands, and Whitespace

## Comments
- Comments begin with `#` and are ignored by the shell.
- Useful for documenting scripts.

### Examples
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# This script prints a greeting
echo "Hello, Linux!"  # Prints message to console
```

---

## Commands
- Commands are instructions given to the shell.
- Can be simple commands or complex pipelines.

### Running Commands
```bash
ls -l /home/user       # List files in long format
pwd                     # Print current working directory
date                    # Show current date and time
```

### Command Arguments
- Arguments modify command behavior.
- Example:
```bash
ls -lh /var/log
```
- `-l` → long listing format
- `-h` → human-readable sizes

---

## Whitespace
- Shell uses whitespace (spaces and tabs) to separate commands and arguments.
- Excessive whitespace is ignored, but missing whitespace can break a command.

### Examples
```bash
# Correct
echo "Hello Linux"

# Incorrect (no space)
echo"Hello Linux"  # Error
```

---

## Command Continuation
- Use `\` to split long commands over multiple lines.

### Example
```bash
echo "This is a very long line that \
continues on the next line"
```

---

## Chaining Commands
- Use `;` to execute multiple commands sequentially.
- Use `&&` to execute the next command only if the previous succeeds.
- Use `||` to execute the next command only if the previous fails.

### Examples
```bash
mkdir /tmp/test && cd /tmp/test   # Only cd if mkdir succeeds
mkdir /tmp/test || echo "Failed to create directory"
```

---

## Practical Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# List files and print working directory
ls -l /etc; pwd
```
- Runs `ls` and then `pwd` sequentially

---

## Summary
- **Comments** (`#`) improve readability
- **Commands** perform actions, arguments modify behavior
- **Whitespace** separates commands and arguments
- **Chaining** (`;`, `&&`, `||`) controls command execution flow
- **Command continuation** (`\`) allows multi-line commands
