## Practical Example: Running a Simple Command

```bash
echo "Hello, Linux!"
```
- `echo` → prints text to standard output

## Key Features
- **Command execution**: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, etc.
- **Variables**: store and use values
- **Control structures**: if, loops
- **Functions**: modularize scripts
- **Text processing**: grep, awk, sed
