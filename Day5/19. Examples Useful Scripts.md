# 19. Examples: Useful Scripts (Backup, Monitor, Installer)

Practical examples of commonly used shell scripts for automation and system management.

---

## 19.1 Backup Script
- Create backups of directories with timestamp

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
SOURCE_DIR="/home/user/data"
BACKUP_DIR="/home/user/backups"
TIMESTAMP=$(date +"%Y%m%d_%H%M%S")
mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz" -C "$SOURCE_DIR" .
echo "Backup completed: $BACKUP_DIR/backup_$TIMESTAMP.tar.gz"
```

- Creates compressed backup in `backups` directory

---

## 19.2 System Monitor Script
- Monitor CPU, memory, and disk usage

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "System Monitoring Report"
date
echo "CPU Usage:"
top -b -n1 | grep "Cpu(s)"
echo "Memory Usage:"
free -h
echo "Disk Usage:"
df -h
```
- Provides snapshot of system resource usage

---

## 19.3 Installer Script
- Automate software installation and setup

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Updating system..."
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

echo "Installing required packages..."
sudo apt install -y git curl vim

echo "Cloning project repository..."
git clone https://github.com/example/project.git ~/project

echo "Installation completed!"
```
- Automates setup process for new systems

---

## 19.4 Practical Tips
- Always **check exit codes** for reliability
- **Log output** to files for troubleshooting
- Use **functions** to modularize repetitive tasks
- Use **set -euo pipefail** for robustness

### Logging Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
LOGFILE="/var/log/myscript.log"
{
    echo "Script started at $(date)"
    # commands
    echo "Script finished at $(date)"
} >> "$LOGFILE" 2>&1
```

---

## Summary
- **Backup scripts** → automate data backup with timestamp
- **Monitor scripts** → track system performance
- **Installer scripts** → automate software and environment setup
- **Best practices**: modular functions, logging, error handling, robust execution
- These examples form the foundation for real-world shell automation
