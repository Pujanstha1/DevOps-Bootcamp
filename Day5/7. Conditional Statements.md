# 7. Conditional Statements (if, case) and Test Operators

Conditional statements allow scripts to **make decisions based on conditions**.

---

## 7.1 if Statement
Syntax:
```bash
if [ condition ]; then
    commands
elif [ condition ]; then
    commands
else
    commands
fi
```
- `[` is a synonym for `test`
- `then` marks the start of commands to execute if the condition is true
- `fi` closes the `if` block

### Examples
```bash
#!/bin/bash
age=20
if [ $age -ge 18 ]; then
    echo "You are an adult."
else
    echo "You are a minor."
fi
```
- `-ge` → greater than or equal
- `-lt` → less than
- `-eq` → equal

## 7.2 Test Operators
### Numeric Comparison
| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| -eq      | equal  |
| -ne      | not equal |
| -lt      | less than |
| -le      | less than or equal |
| -gt      | greater than |
| -ge      | greater than or equal |

### String Comparison
| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| =        | equal  |
| !=       | not equal |
| -z       | string is empty |
| -n       | string is not empty |

### File Test Operators
| Operator | Meaning |
|----------|--------|
| -f       | file exists and is regular file |
| -d       | directory exists |
| -r       | readable |
| -w       | writable |
| -x       | executable |

## 7.3 case Statement
- Useful for multiple conditional branches

### Syntax
```bash
case expression in
pattern1)
    commands;;
pattern2)
    commands;;
*)
    default commands;;
esac
```
- `esac` closes the `case` block

### Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter a number: " num
case $num in
1)
    echo "You entered one";;
2)
    echo "You entered two";;
*)
    echo "You entered something else";;
esac
```

---

## 7.4 Practical Examples
1. Check if a file exists:
```bash
file="/tmp/test.txt"
if [ -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "File exists"
else
    echo "File does not exist"
fi
```
2. Multiple string conditions:
```bash
username="pujan"
if [ "$username" = "pujan" ]; then
    echo "Welcome, Pujan"
fi
```
3. Using `case` for options:
```bash
option="start"
case $option in
start)
    echo "Starting service";;
stop)
    echo "Stopping service";;
*)
    echo "Invalid option";;
esac
```

## Summary
- **if** → conditional execution based on true/false
- **elif / else** → multiple branches
- **test operators** → numeric, string, and file checks
- **case** → multi-pattern selection
- Proper conditional statements make scripts **dynamic and responsive**
