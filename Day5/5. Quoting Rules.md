# 5. Quoting Rules: Single, Double, and Unquoted

Quoting controls how the shell interprets special characters, variables, and commands.

---

## 5.1 Single Quotes `' '` 
- Everything inside single quotes is **taken literally**.
- No variable expansion, no command substitution.

### Example
```bash
name="Pujan"
echo 'Hello $name'  # Output: Hello $name
```
- `$name` is not expanded because of single quotes

---

## 5.2 Double Quotes `" "`
- Allows **variable expansion** and **command substitution**.
- Special characters are mostly preserved except `$`, `` ` ``, `\`.

### Example
```bash
name="Pujan"
echo "Hello $name"        # Output: Hello Pujan
current_dir=$(pwd)
echo "Current directory: $current_dir"
```

---

## 5.3 Unquoted
- Words are split on **whitespace**.
- Globbing (wildcards `*`, `?`) and variable expansion occur.
- Can cause errors if variables contain spaces.

### Example
```bash
file="My File.txt"
echo $file   # Output: My File.txt
ls *.txt    # Lists all .txt files in directory
```
- Better to quote variables with spaces: `echo "$file"`

---

## 5.4 Escape Characters
- Use backslash `\` to **escape special characters**.

### Example
```bash
echo "This is a \$100 bill"   # Output: This is a $100 bill
echo 'It's working!'             # Output: It's working!
```

---

## Practical Examples
1. Using variables safely:
```bash
filename="My Document.txt"
echo "$filename"    # Correct
```
2. Command substitution with quotes:
```bash
current_date=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")
echo "Today is $current_date"
```
3. Using single quotes to prevent expansion:
```bash
echo 'The cost is $100'   # Literal output
```

---

## Summary
- **Single quotes `' '`** → literal, no expansion
- **Double quotes `" "`** → allows variables and command substitution
- **Unquoted** → variables expand, whitespace splits words, wildcards work
- **Escape `\`** → prevent special character interpretation
- Proper quoting **prevents errors** and ensures scripts handle spaces and special characters safely
