## Transform EC2 and S3 CloudFormation Templates into Terraform code

### Description

EC2 and S3 (Secure) have already been written in CFT in the previous classes.

Rewrite them in Terraform using only Providers, Resources and Data Sources in one main.tf file if possible.

Launch the resources written in Terraform to validate your code.

Document your process and also include State Management explanation in your process.
